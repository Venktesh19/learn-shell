# learn-shell
Hi, starting shell scripting
1. Create a instance in aws and open it in putty. 
2. Go to <README.md> directory and run command <cat README.md> to showcase the script written in the local system.
3. Again if we did any change in local system then again commit and push, but in server run git pull (this will pull all the data which is change) and show on the terminal.
